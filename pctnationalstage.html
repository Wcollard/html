    <h3>What is the national phase?</h3>
    
    The national phase is the second of the two main phases of the PCT procedure. It follows the international phase and consists in the processing of the international application before each Office of or acting for a Contracting State that has been designated in the international application (refer to International Phase). In each designated State the international application has the effect of a national (or regional) application as from the international filing date, and the decision to grant protection for the invention is the task of the Office of or acting for that State (the “designated Office”). The national phase of processing the international application by the designated Office is generally delayed until the termination of the international phase on the expiration of the time limits indicated in paragraphs 3.001 and 3.002.
    See Article 11(3), Article 23, Article 40</p>
<p>
   <h4>When is an Office a designated Office?</h4> 
Article 2(xiii), Article 4
The national Office of a Contracting State is a “designated Office” if the State is “designated” in the international application for national protection. The filing of a request constitutes the designation of all Contracting States that are bound by the Treaty on the international filing date. However, some States may be excluded from this all-inclusive designation
</p>
<p>
   <h4>How does the national phase start?</h4> 
The national phase starts only if the applicant performs certain acts, either before the expiration of a certain time limit or together with an express request that it start earlier. The applicant should not expect any notification inviting him to perform those acts. He has sole responsibility for performing them in due time. The consequences of failure to do so are fatal to the application in a number of designated States (refer to paragraphs 4.003 and 4.004). It should be noted that the acts must be performed in due time even if, for some reason, the international search report and the written opinion of the International Searching Authority or the international preliminary report on patentability (Chapter I or II of the PCT) are not yet available. Details of the acts to be performed and the applicable time limits are given in the following paragraphs.
Article 22(1), Article 23, Article 39(1)(a), Article 40
</p>
<p>
   <h4>What must be done by the applicant before the start of the national phase? </h4>
<h5>The following acts must be performed (if applicable):</h5>
<ol>
    <li> payment of the national fee (refer to paragraphs 4.005 to 4.007);</li>
    <li> furnishing of a translation, if prescribed (refer to paragraphs 4.008 to 4.026);</li>
    <li> in exceptional cases (if a copy of the international application has not been communicated to the designated Office under Article 20), furnishing of a copy of the international application, except where not required by that Office (refer to paragraphs 4.027 and 4.028);
    </li>    
    <li>in exceptional cases (if the name and address of the inventor were not given in the request when the international application was filed, but the designated Office allows them to be given at a time later than that of the filing of a national application), furnishing of the indication of the name and address of the inventor (refer to paragraphs 4.030 and 4.031).</li>  </ol></p>
<p><h4>In which case must the international application be translated? see Article 4.008. </h4>
    A translation of the international application must be furnished if the language in which it was filed or published is not a language accepted by the designated Office.
    4.009. What is the language into which the international application must be translated?
    See Article 22(1), Article 39(1)(a), Rule 49.1(a)(i), Rule 76.5 Rule 49.1(a)(i), Rule 76.5</p>
<p>    The language or languages prescribed by the designated Offices are given in the National Chapter (Summary) relating to each Office. Where several languages are given, the applicant may choose the language which suits him best. It should be noted that the language in which the translation of the international application is furnished is usually also the language for the whole procedure before the designated Office.</p>
</p>
<p>  
<h4>Can one request early processing?</h4>Where the applicant makes an express request for early processing of the international application (refer to paragraphs 2.006 and 3.004) before the communication of the international application has taken place, he must either furnish a copy of the international application, and of any amendment filed under Article 19 with the International Bureau, at the same time as he makes the express request for early processing to the designated Office or request the International Bureau to transmit a copy of his international application to the designated Office in accordance with Article 13(2)(b). The other acts prescribed for entering the national phase must naturally also be complied with.

Article 13(2)(b), Article 22(1), Article 23(2), Article 39(1)(a), Article 40(2), Rule 47.4</p>
